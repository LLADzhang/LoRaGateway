<h2>Descrption:</h2>

"ifroglab LoRa  USB  dongle" is a type of low cost RF front-end transceiver module based on SX1272 from Semtech Corporation. It keeps the advantages of RFIC SX1272 but simplifies the circuit design. The high sensitivity (-137dBm) in LoRa modulation and 20dBm high power output make the module suitable for low range and low data rate applications.

"ifroglab LoRa  USB  dongle"  module consists of RFIC SX1272 and include powerful MCU, thin SMD crystal and antenna matching circuit. The antenna port is well matched to standard 50 Ohm impedance. Users don’t need to spend time in RF circuit design and choose suitable antennas for different applications. iL-LORA1272 operates at 1.8~3.6V with extra low standby current which makes it suitable for battery powered-up applications. Because iL-LORA1272 is purely hardware module and it adopts ±10ppm crystal which the resolution of it places a important role in calculating spreading factor, bandwidth, etc.

In addition, We’er add powerful MCU to help Users that don’t needs to read the datasheet of SX1272, you just go through UART to control this module and will easy to use the module in the best performance.
